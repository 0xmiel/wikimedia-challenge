# wikimedia-challenge

I used EventStreams (a web service that exposes continuous streams of structured event data over HTTP)
to connect to the MediaWiki RecentChanges EventStream and d3.js to draw the globe and barcharts.

Thanks to EventStreams, everything is done client-side. A full write-up is coming soon :)
